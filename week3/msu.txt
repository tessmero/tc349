MSU's homepage is aesthetically pleasing, with reasonable and consistent gradients in every solid-color component. I was also pleased to find that almost every click-able element responded to mouse hovering in a satisfying way. The perfect shadows and fonts signal the work of a team of hired professionals. I have to say it was a bit of a let-down to scroll to the bottom and find the ONE panel that correspond with he gradient style of the page.

Examining the page source shows a well-structured hierarchy. I appreciated that there were relatively few <script> tags within the body of the html. Even better, there was one javascript element which simply initialized and populated a set of arrays. By populating the arrays all together and outside of any handling code, the developers created a useful separation between content and behaviour/style. Large chunks of repeated code indicate a server-side rendering engine. The developers probably make their changes on a reduced version of the source code (using some technology like ASP.net or Razor).
