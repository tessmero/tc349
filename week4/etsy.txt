I'd never been on Etsy before, so I was rather blown away by the peacefulness of the design. Aside from the consistent colors and square shapes, the designers did a good job expressing modesty. What I mean by this is that they refrained from adding a flashy navigation bar or any animations. Everything necessary to find your bearings is plainly listed at the top of the page.

To get really nit-picky, the search bar would have looked better without the slight shadow/shine effect. All the other interface elements are plain, solid color so it's a shame to see any inconsistency. Also it would have been nice to see some elements expand when clicked, but mostly I feel that way because I didn't want to have to leave the main page. As you start navigating to other pages the style becomes less peaceful.

Source code is actually readable, with real spaces and indents for most lines. on every page I checked I found multiple logical comment tags like <!--[if IE]>.
