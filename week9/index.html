			<h2>HeatMap Editor</h2>
			<p>The Heatmap editor is a suit of visualization tools that centers around the visualization of value spreadsheets in heatmaps.</p>
			<p>Researchers interested in developing publishable figures will understand the amount of time that goes into prototyping. Developing and tweaking heatmaps in R, for example, often requires running a similar command hunderds of times until the desired result is achieved. Users of the Heatmap Editor are provided with the ability to make such adjustments in real-time.</p>

			<p>Is this the real life? is this just fantasy? caught in a landslid, no escape from reality. Open your eyes, look up to the skies and seeeeeeee. I'm just a poor boy. I need no sympathy. Cus it's easy come, easy go, little high, little low.</p>
