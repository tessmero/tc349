		<h1>Games</h1>
		<p>Oliver Tessmer is willing to admit that he spends far too much time stuck at home in front of a monitor.</p>
		<p>His extensive experience makes me qualified to list the top 3 video games of all time</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li value="3">Burnout: Paradise</li>
			<img src="images/BurnoutParadiseImage.jpg"></img>
			<p>No other racing game even comes close. Burnout: Paradise tops the small list of open-world racing games, bringing a fantastic soundtrack together with crisp graphics. All of this is built on an impeccably well-optimized physics engine.</p>
			<li value="2">Smash Bros Melee</li>
			<img src="images/SmashBros.jpg"></img>
			<p>The concept is simple. You control a character who wants to stay on a platform. You want to knock other characters off the platform. Add in decades of Nintendo characters, each with a large set of unique moves and you've got a fighting-platformer for the ages. Smash Bros dominates the childhood memories of 90% of male MSU students.</p>
			<li value="1">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</li>
			<img src="images/Ocarina.jpg"></img>
			<p>Ocarina of Time chronicles the adventures of Link, from childhood to adulthood. The first game to properly feature a gigantic fully connected game world. Words cannot describe the feeling of entering one of many sprawling dungeons for the first time.
