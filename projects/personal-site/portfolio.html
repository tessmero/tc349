		<h1>Portfolio</h1>
		<p>Oliver has been honing his software development skill for some years, and is eager to showcase a small portion his portfolio for you</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Visual Phenomics</li>
			<p>Developed under his research assistant-ship at the MSU Plant Research Lab, this program extracts numerical measurements from images captured by on-site plant growth chambers. Users generally use a preview image to select plant positions, then click buttons to analyse those plants through a full time-series of images. Output's charts and spreadsheets relating to growth and photosynthetic efficiency</p>
			<li>Heatmap Editor</li>
			<img src="images/heat.jpg"></img>
			<p>An ongoing endeavour originally developed for producing academic figures, this project has grown into a powerful analysis tool capable of running a plethora of statistical comparisons, sorting operations, and graphical effects. The interface consists of a series of dock-able "internal frames" all enclosed in one window. As the user loads datasets, applies sorting/comparisons, and builds beautiful figures, every linked component updates fluidly in real-time. Oliver hopes this will become the flagship product of his fortune-500 company.</p>
